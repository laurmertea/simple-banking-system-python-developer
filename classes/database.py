# Description
# It's very upsetting when the data about registered users disappears after the program is completed. 
# To avoid this problem, you need to create a database 
# where you will store all the necessary information about the created credit cards. 
# We will use SQLite to create the database.
# SQLite is a database engine. It is software that allows users to interact with a relational database. 
# In SQLite, a database is stored in a single file — a trait that distinguishes it from other database engines. 
# This allows for greater accessibility: copying a database is no more complicated than copying the file that stores the data, 
# and sharing a database implies just sending an email attachment.
# You can use the sqlite3 module to manage SQLite database from Python. 
# You don't need to install this module. It is included in the standard library.
# To use the module, you must first create a Connection object that represents the database. 
# Here the data will be stored in the example.s3db file:
#   import sqlite3
#   conn = sqlite3.connect('example.s3db')
# Once you have a Connection, you can create a Cursor object and call its execute() method to perform SQL queries:
#   cur = conn.cursor()
# Executes some SQL query
#   cur.execute('SOME SQL QUERY')
# After doing some changes in DB don't forget to commit them!
#   conn.commit()
# To get data returned by SELECT query you can use fetchone(), fetchall() methods:
#   cur.execute('SOME SELECT QUERY')
# Returns the first row from the response
#   cur.fetchone()
# Returns all rows from the response
#   cur.fetchall()
#
# Instruction
# In this stage, create a database named card.s3db with a table titled card. It should have the following columns:
#   id INTEGER
#   number TEXT
#   pin TEXT
#   balance INTEGER DEFAULT 0
# Pay attention: your database file should be created when the program starts, 
# if it hasn’t yet been created. And all created cards should be stored in the database from now.
# Do not forget to commit your DB changes right after executing a query!
# 
# Example
# The symbol > represents the user input. 
# Notice that it's not a part of the input.
# 1. Create an account
# 2. Log into account
# 0. Exit
# >1
#
# Your card has been created
# Your card number:
# 4000003429795087
# Your card PIN:
# 6826
#
# 1. Create an account
# 2. Log into account
# 0. Exit
# >2
#
# Enter your card number:
# >4000003429795087
# Enter your PIN:
# >4444
#
# Wrong card number or PIN!
#
# 1. Create an account
# 2. Log into account
# 0. Exit
# >2
#
# Enter your card number:
# >4000003429795087
# Enter your PIN:
# >6826
#
# You have successfully logged in!
#
# 1. Balance
# 2. Log out
# 0. Exit
# >1
#
# Balance: 0
#
# 1. Balance
# 2. Log out
# 0. Exit
# >2
#
# You have successfully logged out!
#
# 1. Create an account
# 2. Log into account
# 0. Exit
# >0
#
# Bye!
