# Description
# In this stage, we will find out what the purpose of the checksum is and what the Luhn algorithm is used for.
# The main purpose of the check digit is to verify that the card number is valid. 
# Say you're buying something online, and you type in your credit card number incorrectly by accidentally swapping two digits, 
# which is one of the most common errors. 
# When the website looks at the number you've entered and applies the Luhn algorithm to the first 15 digits, 
# the result won't match the 16th digit on the number you entered. 
# The computer knows the number is invalid, and it knows the number will be rejected if it tries to submit the purchase for approval, 
# so you're asked to re-enter the number. 
# Another purpose of the check digit is to catch clumsy attempts to create fake credit card numbers. 
# Those who are familiar with the Luhn algorithm, however, could get past this particular security measure.
#
# Luhn Algorithm in action
# The Luhn algorithm is used to validate a credit card number or other identifying numbers, 
# such as Social Security. The Luhn algorithm, also called the Luhn formula or modulus 10, 
# checks the sum of the digits in the card number and checks whether the sum matches the expected result 
# or if there is an error in the number sequence. After working through the algorithm, 
# if the total modulus 10 equals zero, then the number is valid according to the Luhn method.
# While the algorithm can be used to verify other identification numbers, 
# it is usually associated with credit card verification. The algorithm works for all major credit cards.
# Here is how it works for a credit card with the number 4000008449433403:
# If the received number is divisible by 10 with the remainder equal to zero, then this number is valid; 
# otherwise, the card number is not valid. When registering in your banking system, 
# you should generate cards with numbers that are checked by the Luhn algorithm. 
# You know how to check the card for validity. But how do you generate a card number so that it passes the validation test? 
# It's very simple!
# First, we need to generate an Account Identifier, which is unique to each card. 
# Then we need to assign the Account Identifier to our BIN (Bank Identification Number). 
# As a result, we get a 15-digit number 400000844943340, so we only have to generate the last digit, which is a checksum.
# To find the checksum, it is necessary to find the control number for 400000844943340 by the Luhn algorithm. 
# It equals 57 (from the example above). The final check digit of the generated map is 57+X, where X is checksum. 
# In order for the final card number to pass the validity check, 
# the check number must be a multiple of 10, so 57+X must be a multiple of 10. The only number that satisfies this condition is 3.
# Therefore, the checksum is 3. So the total number of the generated card is 4000008449433403. 
# The received card is checked by the Luhn algorithm.
# You need to change the credit card generation algorithm so that they pass the Luhn algorithm.
# 
# Instruction
# You should allow customers to create a new account in our banking system.
# Once the program starts you should print the menu:
#   1. Create an account
#   2. Log into account
#   0. Exit
# If the customer chooses ‘Create an account’, you should generate a new card number that satisfies all the conditions described above. 
# Then you should generate a PIN code that belongs to the generated card number. 
# PIN is a sequence of 4 digits; it should be generated in the range from 0000 to 9999.
# If the customer chooses ‘Log into account’, you should ask to enter card information.
# After the information has been entered correctly, you should allow the user to check the account balance; 
# after creating the account, the balance should be 0. It should also be possible to log out of the account and exit the program.
#
# Example
# The symbol > represents the user input. 
# Notice that it's not a part of the input.
# 1. Create an account
# 2. Log into account
# 0. Exit
# >1
# 
# Your card has been created
# Your card number:
# 4000004938320896
# Your card PIN:
# 6826
# 
# 1. Create an account
# 2. Log into account
# 0. Exit
# >2
# 
# Enter your card number:
# >4000004938320896
# Enter your PIN:
# >4444
# 
# Wrong card number or PIN!
# 
# 1. Create an account
# 2. Log into account
# 0. Exit
# >2
# 
# Enter your card number:
# >4000004938320896
# Enter your PIN:
# >6826
# 
# You have successfully logged in!
# 
# 1. Balance
# 2. Log out
# 0. Exit

# Balance: 0
# 
# 1. Balance
# 2. Log out
# 0. Exit
# >2
# 
# You have successfully logged out!
#

# 2. Log into account
# 0. Exit
